This is hinting about either Avocado or Peanuts as "Snack" which is Bip39 word, also MOTH with the Butterfly thats been shown in puzzle and multiple places including barcode, MOTH isn't Bip39 but Silk is, and that right there is a Silk moth/butterfly, could "Silk" which is Bip39 word be it for the butterflies? 


2: Avocado is Number 3 in the wordlist:

Hinting at Avocado being Number 3, which helps a lot but.. Which word is the avocado one? Could it just be.  "Avocado" or "Snack" or is snack referring to Peanuts only? Or even Seed etc..nothing is concrete as of yet (13th Feb 2025)


3: Peanuts Hint:

As you can see, hinting that one of the words is "Peanuts" which was rasy but.  Saying between meals at the end there.. Maybe "Snack" was the actual word not Peanut all along. 


4: Switch Hint:

I mean..yeah..Switch was obvious, nothing to see here. 


5: "Cows" Hint:

Breaking Down the Twitter Hint

"You might need a scientist" → This suggests scientific terms, possibly biology, chemistry, or physics.

"or a thesaurus" → This hints at synonyms, word variations, or alternative meanings.

"for what’s on the wall" → The answer likely relates to things depicted on the wall in the image.

Words hinted are: "Cattle" for the animals (This one is correct) , and "Fly" or "Silk" for the clear Silk Moth where the blue arrow pointed at, Others are "Wing" but unlikely. 

These words align with the scientist/thesaurus clue from the tweet.


6: Profession Hint:

"My profession was obsolete" → A profession that is no longer common

"I think my place looks nice!" → Something visually appealing (architecture, nature, or preservation)

This one is confusing.. Could be "Typer" as girl is always seen typing and its obsolete profession but may not hint at all about the "Phone" part and could be "Architect" for the nice home they are in.. This one i am still working on, more to share soon! 


7:"401" Followers..?:

No #Defipuzzleclue but.. Very confusing how he never celebrated any follower milestone til 401.. Which the number 401 in Bip39 wordlist is.. "Craft" so could Craft be one of 12 words? And not Pottery/Vessel or even Jar a possibility at all? Interesting. 

Could be linked to the "Profession Obsolete" Hint. 


8: Eye..? Hint..:

![Screenshot_20250213_154537_X](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932193de-6a2d-4a9c-a892-dbfd79d61acd)

The puzzle creator seen here @EcoBuildr (@HEXfutures on YouTube same person) has tweeted about the puzzle suddenly and put the word "Eye" balls in thr tweet.. Hinting one of the blue pointers is indeed the word "Eye" but..maybe not? 









And that concludes all X/Twitter hints i could gather and all available #Defipuzzleclue stuff...for now.
